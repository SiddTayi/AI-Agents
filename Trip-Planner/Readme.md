🧠 How It Works
Our system operates with a sophisticated multi-agent architecture, each specializing in a crucial aspect of trip planning:

Agents 🕵️‍♀️:

Role: This agent is the data backbone. It's responsible for fetching raw, up-to-date information about the destination city.
Capabilities: Utilizes web search and web scraping to gather details on popular attractions, local events, trending restaurants, accommodation options, transportation, and more. It filters out irrelevant or outdated information to ensure data freshness.
The Guide Agent 🗣️:

Role: This is the empathetic, interactive layer that understands your unique travel needs.
Capabilities: Through Natural Language Understanding (NLU), it interprets your preferences (e.g., "I love historical sites and good food, but I'm on a budget," "I'm traveling with kids," "I want an adventurous trip"). It engages in a conversational manner, asking clarifying questions to build a comprehensive user profile, including budget, time limits, and specific interests.
The Planner Agent 📅:

Role: This agent is the architect, combining the city data with your personalized preferences to craft a bespoke itinerary.
Capabilities: Applies optimization algorithms to create efficient routes, groups nearby attractions, and generates personalized recommendations. It ensures the itinerary adheres to all your specified constraints and presents it in a clear, user-friendly, day-by-day breakdown.
🛠️ Technologies Used
