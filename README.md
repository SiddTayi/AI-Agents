### âœ¨ What's Inside?

This repository will host a diverse range of AI agent projects. Each project will reside in its own dedicated directory, complete with its own `README.md` and necessary files to run it independently. You'll find agents designed for:

* **Information Gathering**: Agents that interact with external tools like web search, APIs, and databases to gather and synthesize information (like the Trip Planning Agent!).
  * **Trip Planning Agents**: Agents leveraging the power of AI and external tools to curate a detailed trip itinerary based on the user's preferece.  

#### Comming up
* **Automation & Productivity**: Agents that automate tasks, manage schedules, or assist with data processing.
* **Gaming & Simulation**: Agents that play games, simulate environments, or demonstrate intelligent decision-making in virtual worlds.
* **Creative & Generative**: Agents that generate text, code, art, or assist in creative processes.
* **Interactive & Conversational**: Chatbots and agents designed for natural language interaction.
